# LynX Business Integrator - LynX.NET Tutorial

Aellius LynX Business Integrator (LBI) is a .NET based integration platform for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne.
This tutorial walks you through the process of creating a simple Business Process that 
reads Address Book records (F0101) and executes a business function for each of those 
records.

When the Business Process is deployed to the LBI Runtime, it is instantly available 
as a web service that can be consumed by both REST and SOAP clients.
